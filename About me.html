<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Simtha Mncube, a 19-year-old Information Science student with a strong passion for web development and creative problem-solving. I thrive on challenges and enjoy finding smart, simple solutions through code.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I’m very active — I love playing sports, going to the gym, and spending quality time with my friends and family. I’m a people person who enjoys working in teams and learning from others.</p>

<p>Whether I’m on the field or in front of a computer, I bring energy, creativity, and determination to everything I do. I’m always open to new ideas and new people, and I’m excited about building a career where I can grow, create, and make a difference.</p>
